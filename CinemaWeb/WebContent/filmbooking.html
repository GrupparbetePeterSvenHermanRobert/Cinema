					<h3>Rambo 19</h3>
					<p>Action	2018</p>
					<p>130	15</p>
					<p>Vietnam veteran John Rambo has survived many harrowing ordeals in his lifetime and <br>
					   has since withdrawn into a simple and secluded existence in Thailand, where he spends <br>
					   his time capturing snakes for local entertainers, and chauffeuring locals in his old PT boat. <br>
					   Even though he is looking to avoid trouble, trouble has a way of finding him:<br>
					    a group of Christian human rights missionaries, led by Michael Burnett and Sarah Miller, <br>
					    approach Rambo with the desire to rent his boat to travel up the river to Burma.<br>
					    For over fifty years, Burma has been a war zone. The Karen people of the region, <br>
					    who consist of peasants and farmers, have endured brutally oppressive rule from the <br>
					    murderous Burmese military and have been struggling for survival every single day.</p>
